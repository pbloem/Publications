\usepackage{benelearn2013}

% Employ this version of the ``usepackage'' statement after the paper has
% been accepted, when creating the final version.  This will set the

\usepackage{graphicx} % more modern
%\usepackage{epsfig} % less modern

Abstracts and papers should be submitted electronically, no later than March 12, 2013. Notification of acceptance is on April 16.

BENELEARN 2013 will rely exclusively on electronic formats for submission and review. Authors are expected to write their paper with the \textbf{\LaTeX} editor, for which electronic templates are accessible at the BENELEARN website. If you are using the templates, the formatting instructions below will already be enforced.

References must include page numbers whenever possible and be as complete as possible. Place multiple citations in chronological order. For abstracts dealing with published work, please indicate this in the text and provide the appropriate references. The review process will be single blind, so also mention your name and affiliation. Please consult the template for full papers to format references. If the authors' names are included in the sentence, place only
the year in parentheses, for example when referencing Rob Schapire's seminal result \yrcite{schapire90}. Otherwise place the entire reference in parentheses with the authors and year separated by a comma \cite{schapire90,kearns89}.

An abstract should not be longer than one page. Submission to BENELEARN 2013 will be entirely electronic, through Easychair.  The URL and information about the submission process will appear on the conference web site. To ensure our ability to print submissions, authors must provide their manuscripts in PDF format.

Authors need to pay close attention to the typefaces used. More information about this can be found in the template for full papers. Problems can be avoided by using the \textbf{pdflatex} program instead of straight \LaTeX. This program avoids the Type-3 font problem, however you must ensure that all of the fonts are embedded (use {\tt
pdffonts}).
